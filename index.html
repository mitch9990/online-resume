        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Mitchell Finch, I am 24 years old from Kent in the UK. I am a big Anime fan and a huge Star Wars nerd.
            I love drawing and being creative, by hand and digitally. I enjoy learning new things, overcoming challenges
            and putting my mind to the test to solve problems. Currently I am learning how to code because I have aspirations
            of becoming a Web Developer, for a big tech company. I have never felt more passion and motivation in my life than when I am learning to code and build websites. I hope to vastly improve my skills, reach my goals and dive head first into the exciting tech industry.</p>
